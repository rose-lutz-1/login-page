## Basic Authentication Service

## Description

Simple authenitication service with a REST api. If you run the project and connect to localhost:3000, you can can interact with the database with the basic GET, PUT, DELETE, and POST.
I used a MySQL container in docker. I connected to the container with MySQL with the following settings:
Hostname: 127.0.0.1
Port: 3306
Username: root
Password: <password>
Default Schema: <blank>
  
I used Insomnia to connect to the local host to run and test the code. 

## Roadmap
  - logout capability
  - access token expiration
  - unit testing
  - front end/learn svelte
